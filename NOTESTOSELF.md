This document is for notes to myself on this project.

# Coding style

## Line breaks
- No more than one blank line in a row
- No blank lines after opening brackets or before closing brackets of a class/interface definition
- A final new line must be present at the end of file

## Lombok
- Temporary use of Lombok is OK while in development, but should eventually be delomboked
